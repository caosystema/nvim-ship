# VIM URL (WIP)
*nvim-vurl is a Neovim plugin cURL client (REST, GraphQL, etc) written in Lua.*

- VURL is based on `curl` so is required to be installed and `jq` for JSON formatting. 
- This plugin has been developed on and for Linux following open source philosophy.

## Installation

Plug 'javi-7/nvim-vurl'
```
`Packer`

use 'javi-7/nvim-vurl'
```

## Usage

```lua
print('something')
```

print('configuration')
```
